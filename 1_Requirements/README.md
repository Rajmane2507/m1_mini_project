# REQUIREMENT:-

## INTRODUCTION

## SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR

A Scientific Calculator is a calculator designed to help you calculate science, engineering, and mathematics problems.
It has way more buttons than your standard calculator that just lets you do your four basic arithmetic operations of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication,division, modulus, power and factorial.


# FEATURES:-

1.Scientific calculators include modulus memory.

2.These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with a any component. 

3.Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# COST AND FUNCTIONS:-

Depending upon the project how well it is built and all the requirements will meet the cost and it can be varied according to the market.

Addition : The addition Add(+) function takes two operands as input and the function results in a+b.

Subtraction : The subtraction Sub(-) function takes two operands as input and the function results in a-b.

Division : The division Div(/) function takes two operands as input and the function results in a/b.

Power : The power() function takes two operands as input and the function results in X^Y value.

Modulus : The modulus(|x|) function takes two operands as input and the function results in |x| value.

Factorial: The factorial(!) function takes one operands as input and the function results in X! value.




# RESEARCH:-

The project will be a simple Scientific Calculator implementation in C. You will use various 
calculations to calculate different mathematical operations. The output of the project will be a 
console application without any graphics. You should implement at least following mathematical 
operations.
operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication Division.
It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the required result rather 
than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, 
the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.

# 4W's and 1'H :-

- # Who

Any student can use it.

- # Where

It has to be used easily by the users


- # When

It has to be deployed 25th of November 2021.

- # Why

I am Developing this basic scientific calculator to perform basic operation in best easy manner and improve my coding skills.
We can except the results that user can perform mathematical operations like arthimetic and Scientific operations.
All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

- # How

I am using C programming language for Developing this simple basic scientific calculator
