# REQUIREMENT:-

## INTRODUCTION

## SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR

A Scientific Calculator is a calculator designed to help you calculate science, engineering, and mathematics problems. 
It has way more buttons than your standard calculator that just lets you do your four basic arithmetic operations of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

# FEATURES:-

1.Scientific calculators include exponents, log, natural log (ln), trig functions, and memory.
2.These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with a geometry component. 
3.Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# RESEARCH:-

The project will be a simple Scientific Calculator implementation in C. You will use various 
calculations to calculate different mathematical operations. The output of the project will be a 
console application without any graphics. You should implement at least following mathematical 
operations.
2D Matrix operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Transpose.
Solution of non-linear polynomial equations [ 2nd order only, 3
rd order is optional ]

# Defining Our System:-

the project is based on the operating basic arithmetic operations

# SWOT ANALYSIS:-

 ## A) STRENGTHS:

1.Easy Accessibility.
2.easy to use.
3.It aids in the development of logic and problem-solving abilities.

 ## B) WEAKNESSES
 
Traditional file system, no database.

 ## C) OPPORTUNITIES
 
Quick solution of the problem.

 ## D) THREATS
 


# 4W's and 1'H :-

- # What

Any student can use it.

- # Where
